Mitosis
=======

Mitosis is an application for preserving and sharing research data.  It is based on the idea of behaviour annotation,
that is describing what was done to the data and why.

It is the thesis project of [Daniel Yule](http://web.cs.dal.ca/~yule) at [Dalhousie University](http://dal.ca).
